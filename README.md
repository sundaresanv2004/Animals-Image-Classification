# Cat-Dog-Image-Classification
This project extends the Cat-Dog Image Classification project by incorporating pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models. The aim is to leverage the transfer learning technique to improve the classification accuracy of images containing cats and dogs.

## Overview

Transfer learning allows us to use pre-trained models, which are trained on large-scale datasets, as a starting point for our specific task. By fine-tuning these pre-trained models on our dataset, we can benefit from their learned features and achieve better performance with less training data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of thousands of images of cats and dogs. You can download [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tongpython/cat-and-dog). Each image in the dataset is labeled as either a cat or a dog. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model accurately.
